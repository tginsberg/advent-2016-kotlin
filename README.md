## Advent of Code 2016 Solutions in Kotlin

This repo is my personal attempt at solving the [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016) set of problems with the Kotlin programming language. I had a lot of fun solving these problems in 2015 (which I did in Scala), so let's see how 2016's set goes with Kotlin!

I am trying to solve these on the day they are posted with clear, idiomatic solutions. That means in some cases I will sacrifice performance for a more clear solution. It also means I'll probably go back and brush up on solutions! :)
